Code of Conduct
===============

We want all users to have an enjoyable experience when participating in the
PyWeek challenge and community. All users are expected to abide by this Code
of Conduct. If necessary, the PyWeek organisers will act to enforce it.

Communication
-------------

All entrants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other users of the
PyWeek.org website.

All communication should be appropriate for a general audience, which may
include children and people from many different backgrounds. Sexual language
and imagery are not welcome.

Please be thoughtful when making jokes or discussing sensitive topics or issues
that are likely to have a strong personal effect on some people. If in doubt,
ask for advice or simply moderate your expression.


Harassment
----------

PyWeek is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.

PyWeek will not tolerate harassment in any form, or language, imagery or
behaviour that are:

* sexist, racist or exclusionary
* intimidating or threatening
* insulting or unpleasant

Harassment can include any unwelcome behaviour directed at another person.


Artistic Freedom
----------------

PyWeek is a creative competition, and this Code of Conduct will be considered
more generously in the context of PyWeek entries, where the entry would not
cause serious offence to any potential player, registered with the PyWeek site
or not.

For example, it may be possible to show a limited amount of abusive behaviour,
imagery or language in a game if

* it is not explicit or graphic
* it is justified by setting, or an immersive plot
* it is not aimed at a real individual
* it is not expressed as the view of the entrants
* realistic consequences are presented

If in doubt, avoid these topics in your entries.


If there is a problem
---------------------

If you are troubled by the behaviour of another user, or
are concerned that another user may be in distress, please contact
<daniel@pyweek.org> or <richard@pyweek.org>.

Your concern will be heard in confidence, taken seriously, and dealt with
according to a documented procedure for handling code of conduct reports.

We will investigate promptly and if necessary will take appropriate action.
This could include:

* banning a violator of the Code of Conduct from PyWeek
* passing on details of the incident to authorities

We will provide you with a written statement of the outcome, whatever it is.
