Video Tutorials
---------------

* “`Juice It Or Lose It <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg>`__” an
  awesome presentation about making games more fun with very simple ideas

  series <https://www.youtube.com/user/egoraptor#p/u/6/8FpigqfcvlM>`__
  (caution: contains swearing)


2D Graphics
-----------

* `Kenney <https://kenney.nl/>`_ has a vast library of cute 3D sprites, as well
  as 3D models and sound files
* `OpenGameArt <https://opengameart.org/>`_ has 2D art, 3D models and textures
* `Game Icons <https://game-icons.net/>`_ - a collection of icons representing
  video game tropes


3D Models
---------

* `Models by Quaternius <https://quaternius.com/>`_

Content Creation
----------------

-  `Pyxeledit <https://pyxeledit.com/>`__ is a pixel art, tile map, tile
   set and sprite sheet editor of awesomeness. It’s inspired by
   `Pixothello <http://web.archive.org/web/20170702174844/http://teknopants.com/pixothello/>`__\  but is improved
   in many ways (not the least of which is it’s cross-platform)
-  `Pixen <https://pixenapp.com/>`__ is a really nice pixel art app for
   macOS but it doesn’t have the same awesome tileset creation mode as
   Pyxeledit
-  `Tiled Map Editor <https://www.mapeditor.org/>`_
-  A collection of links to `game assets and various game-dev related
   tools <https://game-assets.zeef.com/andre.antonio.schmitz>`__. Here’s
   a list of `art asset creation
   tools <http://web.archive.org/web/20161206082946/https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/82/tools-for-creating-assets>`__
