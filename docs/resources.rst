:Last reviewed: 2019-02-17

`We asked PyWeek users <https://pyweek.org/d/4008/>`_ for their suggestions
for game development resources.

The following is an attempt to curate the suggestions.


Articles and tutorials
----------------------


- `Fun and Games in Python
  <http://mauveweb.co.uk/posts/2017/08/fun-and-games.html>`_ - a history of
  PyWeek, Pygame, Pyglet and more, with analysis on what makes games fun
- `How to be Successful at PyWeek <https://andrewkelley.me/post/pyweek-success.html>`__
- Some `Game Development Tips & Tricks <http://www.nerdparadise.com/tech/python/pygame/tipsandtricks/>`__
-  `How to fail at
   PyWeek <https://blip.tv/europythonvideos/lt-martijn_faassen-_how_to_fail_at_pyweek-3999788>`__ (`slides <http://startifact.com/pyweekfail/pyweekfail.html>`__)
-  `PyGame wiki <http://pygame.org/wiki/>`__ chock full of
   `tutorials <http://pygame.org/wiki/tutorials?parent=index>`__,
   `game  <http://pygame.org/wiki/resources?parent=index>`__\ `resources <http://pygame.org/wiki/resources?parent=index>`__, \ `distribution
   advice <http://pygame.org/wiki/distributing?parent=index>`__ and
   more.

-  `Game Mechanics Explorer <http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/>`__
-  `Amit's Game Programming Information <http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/gameprog.html>`_ contains
   a huge resource on game design and implementation
-  `Game Accessibility Guidelines <http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/>`__
-  `A Whole Lot of PyGame Examples <https://github.com/Mekire?tab=repositories>`__

  This article is probably one of the most useful I've ever read and is
  great for evaluating whether a game idea is good or not in advance.

- Nice writeup of `various approaches to 2D platformer
  games <http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers/>`__.

Video Tutorials
---------------

* "`Juice It Or Lose It <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg>`__" - an
  awesome presentation about making games more fun with very simple ideas.
* Great video about good \ `game design as illustrated by the Mega Man
  series <http://www.youtube.com/user/egoraptor#p/u/6/8FpigqfcvlM>`__
  (caution: contains swearing)


2D Graphics
-----------

* `Kenney <https://kenney.nl/>`_ has a vast library of cute 3D sprites, as well
  as 3D models and sound files.
* `OpenGameArt <https://opengameart.org/>`_ has 2D art, 3D models and textures.


3D Models
---------

* `Models by Quaternius <http://quaternius.com/assets.html>`_
* `Google Poly <https://poly.google.com/>`_   has many CC low-poly models (but
  it also has other 3D content created by Tilt Brush and other tools, which are
  not useful in games.

Textures
--------

* `CC0Textures.com <https://CC0Textures.com>`_ - public domain PBR texture
  sets 
* `Texture Haven <https://texturehaven.com/>`_


Content Creation
----------------

-  `Pyxeledit <http://pyxeledit.com/>`__ is a pixel art, tile map, tile
   set and sprite sheet editor of awesomeness. It's inspired by
   `Pixothello <http://teknopants.com/pixothello/>`__\  but is improved
   in many ways (not the least of which is it's cross-platform.)
-  `Pixen <http://pixenapp.com/>`__ is a really nice pixel art app for
   OS X but it doesn't have the same awesome tileset creation mode as
   Pyxeledit.
-  `Tiled Map Editor <https://www.mapeditor.org/>`_
-  A collection of links to `game assets and various game-dev related
   tools <https://game-assets.zeef.com/andre.antonio.schmitz>`__.Here's
   a list of `art asset creation
   tools <http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/82/tools-for-creating-assets>`__
