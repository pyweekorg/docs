`We asked PyWeek users <https://pyweek.org/d/4008/>`_ for their suggestions
for game development resources.

The following is an attempt to curate the suggestions.


Articles and tutorials
----------------------


- `Fun and Games in Python
  <http://mauveweb.co.uk/posts/2017/08/fun-and-games.html>`_ - a history of
  PyWeek, Pygame, Pyglet and more, with analysis on what makes games fun
- `How to be Successful at PyWeek <https://andrewkelley.me/post/pyweek-success.html>`__
- Some `Game Development Tips & Tricks <http://www.nerdparadise.com/tech/python/pygame/tipsandtricks/>`__
-  `How to fail at
   PyWeek <https://blip.tv/europythonvideos/lt-martijn_faassen-_how_to_fail_at_pyweek-3999788>`__ (`slides <http://startifact.com/pyweekfail/pyweekfail.html>`__)
-  `PyGame wiki <http://pygame.org/wiki/>`__ chock full of
   `tutorials <http://pygame.org/wiki/tutorials?parent=index>`__,
   `game  <http://pygame.org/wiki/resources?parent=index>`__\ `resources <http://pygame.org/wiki/resources?parent=index>`__, \ `distribution
   advice <http://pygame.org/wiki/distributing?parent=index>`__ and
   more.

   Design <http://www.pixelprospector.com/the-big-list-of-game-design/>`__
-  `Game Mechanics Explorer <http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/>`__
-  `Amit's Game Programming Information <http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/gameprog.html>`_ contains
   a huge resource on game design and implementation
-  `Game Accessibility Guidelines <http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/>`__
-  `A Whole Lot of PyGame Examples <https://github.com/Mekire?tab=repositories>`__
- `Red Blob Games <http://www.redblobgames.com/>`_ has superb interactive
  tutorials on a number of topics.
- On `frame rates, vsync and gameplay simulation <http://pyweek.org/d/4963/#comment-10962>`__.

  <http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134273/evaluating_game_mechanics_for_depth.php?print=1>`_ -
  This article is probably one of the most useful I've ever read and is
  great for evaluating whether a game idea is good or not in advance.

- Nice writeup of `various approaches to 2D platformer
  games <http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers/>`__.

Video Tutorials
---------------

* "`Juice It Or Lose It <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg>`__" - an
  awesome presentation about making games more fun with very simple ideas.
* Great video about good \ `game design as illustrated by the Mega Man
  series <http://www.youtube.com/user/egoraptor#p/u/6/8FpigqfcvlM>`__
  (caution: contains swearing)


2D Graphics
-----------

* `Kenney <https://kenney.nl/>`_ has a vast library of cute 3D sprites, as well
  as 3D models and sound files.


3D Models
---------

* `Google Poly <https://poly.google.com/>`_  has many CC low-poly models (but
  it also has other 3D content created by Tilt Brush and other tools, which are
  not useful in games.

Textures
--------

* `CC0Textures.com <https://CC0Textures.com>`_ - public domain PBR texture
  sets 


Content Creation
----------------

-  `Pyxeledit <http://pyxeledit.com/>`__ is a pixel art, tile map, tile
   set and sprite sheet editor of awesomeness. It's inspired by
   `Pixothello <http://teknopants.com/pixothello/>`__\  but is improved
   in many ways (not the least of which is it's cross-platform.)
-  `Pixen <http://pixenapp.com/>`__ is a really nice pixel art app for
   OS X but it doesn't have the same awesome tileset creation mode as
   Pyxeledit.
-  A collection of links to `game assets and various game-dev related
   tools <https://game-assets.zeef.com/andre.antonio.schmitz>`__.Here's
   a list of `art asset creation
   tools <http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/82/tools-for-creating-assets>`__

Music
-----

-  `Royalty free music by inkaudio <http://www.inkaudio.com>`__
-  `Random music generator <http://fakemusicgenerator.com>`__


Icons
-----

-  `Icons for everything <https://thenounproject.com/>`__ - royalty free
   icons (over 1 million, it claims)


Finding Collaborators
